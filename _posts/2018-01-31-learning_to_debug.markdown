As I continue to code, I noticed that I’m getting better at debugging. When I first started coding, I would easily overlook simply syntax errors. For example, I wouldn’t open a statement correctly because I mistyped one character and it would take (what seemed like) ages to figure out what the issue was. As I gain confidence in my abilities, I’m getting better at quickly pinpointing what the problem is with my code because I’m becoming more familiar with the syntax of the language. If I run into a problem, generally speaking I’m able to accurately determine that I typed +99% of my code correctly and that I have a simple typo. From there, it’s a matter of carefully looking at what was last added from the time everything functioned correctly and scrutinizing each new character.

Sometimes though, the problem is bigger than a typo. The more I know, the more I realize what I don’t know: I know what parts of my code I’m unsure about and may have been written incorrectly. I’ll typically try doing more research first, sometimes across different resources, then I’ll reach out to someone for help. Learning to code is learning a new language; it takes hours of practice and immersing oneself to become fluent with coding. I look forward to learning and expanding my skills.
